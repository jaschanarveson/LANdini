# LANdini
Networking software for laptop ensembles

LANdini
an OSC networking app for LANs
version 0.23 (2014-03-26), by Jascha Narveson
partially based on code from LNX Studio by Neil Cosgrove


What is this?

This is a small program that can act as a routing center for OSC messages between computers on a LAN,
doing the background book-keeping necessary for smoothly functioning and reliable OSC communication, 
especially on wireless routers.  LANdini also maintains a shared network time and an active user list, 
both of which can be accessed by external applications via OSC.
